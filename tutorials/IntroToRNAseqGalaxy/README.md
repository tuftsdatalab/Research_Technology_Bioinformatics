## Description
This course is an introduction to RNA sequencing using Galaxy on [Tufts University's Galaxy server](https://galaxy.cluster.tufts.edu). 
For support with this workshop or Galaxy, see our [Galaxy documentation](https://it.tufts.edu/research-technology/bioinformatics/tufts-galaxy) or email TTS Research Technology [tts-research@tufts.edu](mailto:ltts-research@tufts.edu)


## Goals

Bioinformatics for RNAseq has the following workflow steps
