- Mark duplicate reads in BAM file

## Sort SAM file

Downstream applications require that reads in SAM files be sorted by reference genome coordinates (fields 3 and 4 in each line of our SAM file).
This will assist in fast search, display and other functions.

1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 |
------|------|-----|----|------|------|-----|----|------|-----|----
SRR098401.109756285 |83 | chr10 |94760653 |60 |76M | = | 94760647 | -82 | CTAA… | D?@A... |

We’ll use the [Picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) toolkit for this and othter SAM file manipulations.

Open another script in our course directory called picard.sh
```markdown
cd ..
nano picard.sh
```


Enter the following text:
```markdown
module load picard/2.8.0

picard SortSam \
INPUT=results/na12878.sam \
OUTPUT=results/na12878.srt.bam \
SORT_ORDER=coordinate
```

We have input our SAM file and we will output a Binary Alignment Map (BAM) file, which is a compressed version of SAM format.

Exit nano by typing `^X` and follow prompts to save the file `picard.sh`.

To run the script:
```markdown
sh picard.sh
```

Result:
```markdown

```

Take a look at the results directory:
```markdown
ls results
```

The result shows that the sorted BAM file has been created:
```markdown
na12878.sam  na12878.srt.bam 
```

## Mark Duplicates in BAM file
Many copies are made of a single DNA fragment during the sequencing process.
The amount of duplication may not be the same for all sequences and this can cause biases in variant calling.
Therefore, we mark the duplicates so the variant caller can focus on the unique reads.

Duplicate reads are identified based on their alignment coordinates and CIGAR string.
For example, the below alignment appears to have a G to A mutation in the majority of reads:

<img src="../img/dup_pre.png" width="500">

However, when the duplicates are removed, the number of reads supporting the mutation drops to one.

<img src="../img/dup_post.png" width="500">


Let's add this step to our `picard.sh` script in order to illustrate how to include multiple steps in a single script.
Note that when we run it, we'll rerun our previous steps as well.

```markdown
nano picard.sh
```
Add the following lines to the end of our script:
```markdown

printf  "..... Starting Mark Duplicates ....\n\n"

picard MarkDuplicates \
INPUT=results/na12878.srt.bam \
OUTPUT=results/na12878.srt.markdup.bam \
READ_NAME_REGEX=null \
METRICS_FILE=results/na12878.markdup.txt
```

The first line is a formatted print (`printf`) statement that will display useful log lines when our script is running.
The option `READ_NAME_REGEX=null` is added because our read names, downloaded from `GIAB` do not contain information about the position on the flowcell.
When present this information can help with estimating [optical duplicated](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036834611-MarkDuplicates-Picard-).
Typically, datasets do contain this information and it is best to omit this line when processing your data.

To run our script (Note this will rerun the first step as well. This is only for demonstration purposes.
If you were developing this for your own use, you would instead write all commands and run the script once):
```markdown
sh picard.sh
```

In addition to our previous log, we'll see our log line, followed by the output from Mark Duplicates:
```markdown
…
.... Starting Mark Duplicates ....

### Mark Duplicates Metrics file
The following is the metrics file `na12878.markdup.txt` generated by Picard Mark Duplicates:

| LIBRARY | UNPAIRED_READS_EXAMINED | READ_PAIRS_EXAMINED | SECONDARY_OR_SUPPLEMENTARY_RDS | UNMAPPED_READS | UNPAIRED_READ_DUPLICATES | READ_PAIR_DUPLICATES | READ_PAIR_OPTICAL_DUPLICATES | PERCENT_DUPLICATION | ESTIMATED_LIBRARY_SIZE |

|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Unknown | 29 | 4620 | 2 | 35 | 14 | 425 | 0 | 0.093214 | 23546 |


Normal % duplication for exome sequencing data is 10-30%.
By scrolling to the left in this table we see that our percent duplication is `0.093214%`.

## Index the BAM file

In order to view the alignment with the Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV) we are required to create an index files for our BAM file.
This facilitates fast lookup of genomics coordinates.

Let's continue editing our script:
```markdown
nano picard.sh
```

Add the following lines at the end of the script:
```markdown
printf  '.... Start BAM Indexing ....\n\n'

picard BuildBamIndex \
INPUT=results/na12878.srt.markdup.bam
```

Run our script:
```markdown
sh picard.sh
```

Result, in addition to previous output:
```markdown
.... Start BAM Indexing ....

## BAM Visualization with IGV

1. With a Chrome web browser, visit [https://ondemand.cluster.tufts.edu](https://ondemand.cluster.tufts.edu)
2. Login with your Tufts credentials
3. Choose Interactive Apps->IGV. Set parameters, click “Launch”

3. Choose `Interactive Apps->IGV`. Set parameters below and , click `Launch`
<img src="../img/od_igv_1.png" width="500">
4. Choose the following compute resource parameters: 1 hour, 2 cores, 4 GB memory, Default Batch Parition, Default Reservation

<img src="../img/od_igv_2.png" width="500">
5. Click the blue button `Launch NoVNC in New Tab` when it appears

After this the IGV window will appear, probably as a small window on a grey background.
Click the square icon in the top right corner to maximize the window.

<img src="../img/igv_start.png" width="500">

### Load reference genome and BAM file

1. Choose reference genome by clicking the `Genomes` menu and selecting `Load Genome from Server...`

<img src="../img/igv_1.png" width="500">

2. Scroll down to `Human hg38`

<img src="../img/igv_2.png" width="500">

3. DO NOT check `Download Sequnence`

4. Click `OK`

5. Load the BAM file by clicking the `File` menu and select `Load from File...`

<img src="../img/igv_3.png" width="500">

6. Navigate to the results folder in the course directory, e.g. `/cluster/home/your-user-name/intro-to-ngs/results`.  

7. Select `na12878.srt.markdup.bam`

<img src="../img/igv_4.png" width="500">

You will have the following view:

<img src="../img/igv_genome.png" width="500">

Each row of data is called a track. There are five tracks visible: the top track shows the pq bands of the entire
chromosome, followed by the reference genome coordinate track, followed by two tracks of our alignment (coverage and reads,
respectively) which don't yet show data, followed by a reference genome annotation track called "Genes".

### Examining a gene

1. In the box indicated in green below, type gene name "Cyp2c19" and hit enter.
You will see the gene model display in the “Genes” track, showing vertical bars where exons are located

<img src="../img/igv_5.png" width="500">

Troubleshooting tip: At times IGV on demand will stop allowing the user to type input.
If that happens, close the tab, go back to the on demand window, rejoin the session by clicking `Launch NoVNC in New Tab`.

2. Let's zoom in on exon 7. You can hover over exons in the `Genes` track to get information such as exon number.
Click and drag over a region in the reference coordinate track to zoom in on exon 7 (highlighted in green below.)

<img src="../img/igv_10.png" width="500">

3. We can see that there is a variant in this exon.

<img src="../img/igv_11.png" width="500">

4. Zoom in even further until the nucleotide letters are clear.
Then, hover with your mouse over the coverage track to find out more information about this variant.

<img src="../img/igv_12.png" width="500">


It appear there are two variants next to each other: heterozygous`C>T` at position `chr10:94,842,865` and homozygous
`A>G` at position `chr10:94,842,866`. Next, we'll explore the meaning of these variants.
