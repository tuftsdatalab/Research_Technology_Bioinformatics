## Data for the class

Today we will be working with data from [Rosshart et al. 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867417310656?via%3Dihub#mmc4). In this study they examine the gut microbiome of wild and laboratory mice. In the original study there were 231 samples. However, to make this tutorial run faster we examine 4 wild mice and 4 laboratory mice.
