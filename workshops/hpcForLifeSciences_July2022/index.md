# High Performance Computing For Life Sciences

## Description
This introductory 2-day hybrid workshop will cover the basics of using the Tufts High Performance Compute Cluster (HPC) to manipulate Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. The first day will introduce users to Linux commands and how to use Slurm job scheduler to run and monitor jobs on the HPC. The second day will cover downloading, performing quality control, aligning and viewing Next Generation Sequencing data. This workshop is for any student, staff or faculty that wants to learn about Bioinformatics. 

This workshop is sponsered by DISC and Research Technology. The presenters are:

- Rebecca Batorsky (DISC - Senior Data Scientist)
- Adelaide Rhodes (TTS - Senior Bioinformatics Scientist)
- Jason Laird (TTS - Bioinformatics Scientist)
- Delilah Maloney (TTS - HPC Specialist)
