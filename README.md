## Introduction

The Research Technology team at Tufts University has created several bioinformatics self-guided tutorials and workshops that cover a variety of topics in the field. These trainings are designed to be asynchronous so that learners can move at their own pace.

The menu on the left contains the self-guided tutorials that have been updated recently.

The easiest way to read the tutorial content is from our [Github Page](https://tuftsdatalab.github.io/Research_Technology_Bioinformatics/) link.
